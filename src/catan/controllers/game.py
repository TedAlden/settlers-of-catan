"""Module containing game controller for the Catan board game.

This module contains the `GameController` class which is part of an MVC
architecture. It works as an interface between the game view and the game
model, to abstract complexity and improve maintainability.

Typical usage example:
    ```
    from catan.models.game import GameModel
    model = GameModel()
    controller = GameController(model)
    ```
