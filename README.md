## Introduction

The Settlers of Catan is an attempt at a clone of the game [Catan](https://www.catan.com/) (also known as "The Settlers"), with some small changes in places. It was created as a [group](#the-team) project for a Software Engineering assignment in our second year of University.

## Key Features

- [x] Singleplayer against AI or multiplayer (local/hot-seat).
- [x] Games can be saved and resumed using a JSON save-file.

## Requirements

Project was created with:

- Python version: `3.11.0`
- Pygame version: `2.1.3.dev8`
- Pip version: `23.0`

Setup also assumes access to git CLI.

## Setup

Setup instructions should apply to all platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS).

1. Make sure you have the [required](#requirements) version of Python installed, and the git CLI.

2. Clone the repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TedAlden/settlers-of-catan
    cd settlers-of-catan
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages using `pip`.

    ```
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the game using `python3`.

    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```

> **Note**
> - Some systems may have Python 3 installed as `python3` or `python`, so adjust installation steps as necessary.
> - Debian-based distributions of Linux may not have `pip` pre-installed. In this case, install it using `sudo apt install python3-pip`.

## Development Team

Our team consisted of six people, of which some worked on the development of the software itself and others worked on documentation and other aspects of the project.
